Scrooch is a web-based tool that lets you:

1. **🧩 Build a Scratch 2.0 Mod**  
   Edit the default project using the embedded Scratch 2.0 editor.

2. **🔁 Convert Your SB2 to SWF**  
   Turn your `.sb2` into a `.swf` file using the integrated converter.

3. **🚀 Run It in Ruffle**  
   Play your mod anywhere using modern Flash emulation.

All steps happen on the Scrooch site – no extra software needed.

## 🧪 How It Works

1. Click the **"Create"** dropdown in the Scrooch navbar and choose **"Code"** to open the embedded Scratch 2.0 editor with the default mod project.  
2. Make your changes or build your mod using the editor. **When finished, be sure to save your project as an `.sb2` file — if you don’t save it, you won’t be able to convert it!**  
3. Click **“Next”** to move to the **Convert** page.  
4. On the **Convert** page:  
   - Upload your saved `.sb2` file.  
   - **Follow the instructions shown on the page**, such as selecting **"Show as editor"** or any other required options.  
   - Generate your `.swf` file using the open-source converter created by **AsentientBot**.  
5. Click **“Next”** again to go to the **Play** page.  
6. On the Play page, open your `.swf` using [ruffle.rs/demo](https://ruffle.rs/demo) or any site that supports Ruffle.  

✅ Your Scratch 2.0 mod is now ready to run — no Flash Player required!
